The scanner provide a GUI to scan the attributes of an object. It can
also be used to scan the elements of a hash or an array.

The scanner is a composite widget made of a HList and a text window
(actually a TK::ROText). This widget acts as a scanner to the
object (or hash ref) passed with the 'caller' parameter. The scanner
will retrieve all keys of the hash/object and insert them in the
HList.

When the user double clicks on a key, the corresponding value will be added
in the HList.

If the value is a scalar, the scalar will be displayed in the text window.
(Which is handy if the value is a multi-line string)

Note that the look and fell is completely changed compared to previous
version. 

This module was written with perl5.00503 and Tk 800.020

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Many thanks to Achim Bohnet for all the tests, patches (and reports) he 
made. Many improvements were made thanks to his efforts.

Thanks to Rudi Farkas for the 'watch' patch.
