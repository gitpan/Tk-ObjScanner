This is Version 0.01.  See the "Changes" file for details on
the new features and fixes in this release.

This mopule was written with perl5.004. 


See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Note that this module is in alpha state. Its interface may change (but
I hope not).

Alpha exit criteria:
- When some peoples (well, say 10 guys) tell me that they've used it 
  and did not find major bug with the module or minor problems with the 
  interface.

Legal mumbo jumbo:
