Tk::ObjScanner provides a GUI to scan any perl data including the
attributes of an object.



The scanner is a composite widget made of a HList. This widget acts as
a scanner to the object (or hash ref) passed with the 'caller'
parameter. The scanner will retrieve all keys of the hash/object and
insert them in the HList.

When the user double clicks on a key, the corresponding value will be
added in the HList. If the user use the middle button to open a tied
item, the internals of the tied object will be displayed.

If the value is a scalar, the scalar will be displayed in a popup text
window.

If the value is a code ref, the deparsed code will be displayed in a
popup text window.

This widget can be used as a regular widget in a Tk application or can
be used as an autonomous popup widget that will display the content of
a data structure. The latter is like a call to a graphical
Data::Dumper.

The scanner recognizes:
- pseudo hashes
- tied hashes arrays or scalars
- weak reference (See WeakRef for details)

This module was written with perl5.8.0 and Tk 800.024

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Note that test program (in the 't' directory) can be run interactively
this way :

 perl t/xxx.t 1

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Many thanks to Achim Bohnet for all the tests, patches (and reports) he 
made. Many improvements were made thanks to his efforts.

Thanks to Rudi Farkas for the 'watch' patch.

Thanks to Slavec Rezic for the pseudo-hash prototype.
