Tk::ObjScanner provides a GUI to scan any perl data including the
attributes of an object.

Starting from version 1.020:
- pseudo hashes are also correctly viewed.
- a demo is installed so Tk's widget demo will feature ObjScanner

The scanner is a composite widget made of a HList and a text window
(actually a TK::ROText). This widget acts as a scanner to the
object (or hash ref) passed with the 'caller' parameter. The scanner
will retrieve all keys of the hash/object and insert them in the
HList.

When the user double clicks on a key, the corresponding value will be added
in the HList.

If the value is a scalar, the scalar will be displayed in the text window.
(Which is handy if the value is a multi-line string)

This module was written with perl5.6.0 and Tk 800.022

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

Note that test program (in the 't' directory) can be run interactively
this way :

 perl t/xxx.t 1

Comments and suggestions are always welcome.

Many thanks to Achim Bohnet for all the tests, patches (and reports) he 
made. Many improvements were made thanks to his efforts.

Thanks to Rudi Farkas for the 'watch' patch.

Thanks to Slavec Rezic for the pseudo-hash prototype.
