0.2 1998-02-12

	o removed AutoLoadeer because
	don't use AutoLoader for 3 little function
	defs.  Every 'use AutoLoader' does search auto/mod/ule/autoload.ix
	in  at INC.  I think that this is much more expensive than having perl
        compile the 3 subs (Tom C. mentioned that perl can compile ~10000
	lines/sec).

	o use Data::Dumper only when needed:
	startup gain with replace of 'use Data::Dumper'
	and use 'require Data::Dumper in sub listScan.

	o 2 little POD fixes

	o Makefile.PL: Tk::Multi does not exist. Changed to check for Tk::Multi::Text
